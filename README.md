### Gameplay

Your goal is to find the house that the clues placed on the map are referring to. 
When you think you've found that house, knock its door to find out if you got it right.
You only have 2 guesses, so think wisely!

There are a total of 5 clues, each related with a different sense (sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch).
You can review the clues you've found by clicking on the icons at the top right corner.

As you find new clues, you will start being pursued by kennel trucks. Avoid them at all costs!
